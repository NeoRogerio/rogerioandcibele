Hi! My sister got married in October 2019 (tanti auguri Lucia e Davor <3).

> And what could have been the best gift from my side? 

I've decided to give her a fully customized web app ([https://www.los-bajic.com/](https://www.los-bajic.com/)) for her wedding.
The idea is simple, inside the site you can find all the information about the wedding. For instance, how to get to the location, the wedding programme, etc. A link to a Spotify playlist was also integrated. Guest were then able to add their favourite songs to this it. 


> Well, that's it? 

Of course not. In addition to that, people did have the possibility to choose in a dynamic way which presents give them. More people were able to participate in a gift by simply choosing the amount of money they were willing to spend. They were able to put their email addresses, the message they wanted to share and with a slider then define the amount of money they wanted to give. Once the present was submitted, they were notified via email and my sister got a slack notification.

> Did it work? 

Well, as a result my sister and her husband got a lot of presents. Their wish list shortly before the wedding was almost sold-out! 

> What's next? 

I would like to white-label this solution in the future and to deploy it on a sort of wild-card domain concept. Another idea would be to Integrate a payment solution such as Stripe which will allow to have all payments in-app. Let's see :)
